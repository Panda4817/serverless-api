# Serverless Netlify Api
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/49a3f22f-9f5a-4fb7-94d0-a9f927a7a69e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/panda-serverless-api/deploys)

I needed to request data from a third party News API, which involved an API key. After googling different options, the serverless API system seems to be the best and also gave me an opportunity to learn about something new.

I added a xkcd API that has CORS enabled as the original xkcd API does not have CORS enabled.

I also added an API to fetch the latest Google doodle from the Google doodle API.

I also added an API to fetch a random dad joke from the icanhazdadjoke.com.

All of these APIs are for a chrome extension that replaces the new tab with an informative xkcd themed one instead.
